## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Electron**: Desktop application framework
- **@cliqz/adblocker-electron**: Ad-blocking engine
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend

### Project Structure
```
apps/snapstream-app/
├── main.js           # Electron main process
├── preload.js        # Bridge between main and renderer
├── renderer.js       # UI logic and interactions
├── index.html        # Main UI structure
├── styles.css        # Styling and layout
├── package.json      # Dependencies and scripts
└── README.md         # This file
```

### Key Components

#### Main Process (main.js)
- Creates and manages the application window
- Initializes the ad blocker
- Handles IPC communication for downloads
- Manages application menu

#### Renderer Process (renderer.js)
- Handles UI interactions
- Manages webview navigation
- Detects and filters images
- Communicates with main process

#### Preload Script (preload.js)
- Securely exposes Electron APIs to renderer
- Implements context isolation for security

## Ad Blocker Details

The built-in ad blocker uses the same filter lists as popular ad blockers:
- **EasyList**: Blocks most advertisements
- **EasyPrivacy**: Blocks tracking and analytics

### How It Works
1. Loads filter lists on application startup
2. Intercepts network requests in the webview
3. Blocks requests matching ad/tracker patterns
4. Allows normal content through

### Performance
- Minimal impact on browsing speed
- Filter lists are cached for efficiency
- Runs in the background without user intervention

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + T`: New tab (resets to Google)
- `Ctrl/Cmd + R`: Reload page
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Q`: Quit application

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be 14+)

### Ad blocker not working
- Check the button status (should show green when enabled)
- Try toggling it off and on again
- Reload the current page

### Images not detected
- Ensure the page has finished loading
- Try reloading the page and clicking "Show Images" again
- Some images may be loaded dynamically after page load

### Download issues
- Check that you have write permissions to the selected folder
- Ensure the image URLs are accessible
- Some websites may block direct image downloads

## Development

### Running in Development Mode
```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Electron app with the current code.

### Making Changes
1. Edit the source files (main.js, renderer.js, etc.)
2. Restart the app to see changes
3. For hot reloading, consider using electron-reloader

### Debugging
- Press `F12` or `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + I` to open DevTools
- Check the console for errors and logs
- Use `console.log()` in renderer.js for debugging UI logic
- Check the terminal for main process logs
